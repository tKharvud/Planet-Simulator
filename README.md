# Planet-Simulator
My personal version of Bobert13's Planet Simulator for Sid Meier's Civilization V. Specifically based on LamilLerran's LL3 version, and a lot of the climate-generation code being originally from Cephalo's PerfectWorld3 Mapscript. 

Changelog:
  - Desert tiles bordering forest or jungle are turned into plains.
  - Jungle tiles surrounded by enough mountains get grassland under them. This is to simulate subtropical highlands. 
  - Mountains are assigned continent art-types based on elevation. No visual problems were found in testing.
  - A lot more plains should spawn under forest, especially for the Standard and Arid settings.
